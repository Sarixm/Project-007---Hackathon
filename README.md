# Project 007 - Kid and Individual Detection in Schools

## Overview

Project 007 aims to build an infrastructure for detecting kids and individuals in school environments using camera feeds and AI persona detection. This project is part of our hackathon initiative to enhance school safety and monitoring.

## Features

- Real-time detection of kids and individuals using camera feeds.
- AI-based persona detection to identify and track individuals.
- User interface built with Flutter for easy interaction and monitoring.
- Backend infrastructure to manage and store data securely.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLO**: For real-time object detection.
- **PyTorch**: For building and training the AI models.
- **Flask**: For creating the backend API.
- **Flutter**: For building the user interface.
- **Azure Virtual Machines and Storage**: For hosting and storing data.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.
